## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The Toungoo dynasty (Burmese: တောင်ငူမင်းဆက်, [tàʊɰ̃ŋù mɪ́ɰ̃ zɛʔ]; 
> also spelt Taungoo dynasty, and also known as the Nyaungyan dynasty after 1599, 
> was the ruling dynasty of Burma (Myanmar) from the mid-16th century to 1752. 
> 
> At its peak, Toungoo "exercised suzerainty from present-day Assam, 
> Manipur to the Cambodian marches and from the borders of Arakan to Yunnan" 
> and was  the largest empire and the only great power country in the history of Southeast Asia." 
> 
> The dynasty ruled in two periods: 
> - the First Toungoo Empire (1510–1599) and 
> - the Nyaungyan Restoration (1599–1752).
>
> Its early kings Tabinshwehti and Bayinnaung succeeded in 
> reunifying the territories of the Pagan Kingdom for the first time since 1287 
> and in incorporating the Shan States for the first time, 
> in addition to including Manipur, Chinese Shan States, Siam and Lan Xang. 
> 
> The empire collapsed in the 18 years following Bayinnaung's death in 1581. 
> The dynasty quickly regrouped under the leadership of Nyaungyan Min and his son, 
> Anaukpetlun, who succeeded in restoring a smaller, more manageable kingdom, 
> encompassing Lower Burma, Upper Burma, Shan States and Lan Na by 1622. 
> 
> The Restored Toungoo kings, now based in Ava (Inwa), created a legal and political system 
> whose basic features would continue under the Konbaung dynasty 
> well into the 19th century. 
> 
> The crown completely replaced the hereditary chieftainships 
> with appointed governorships in the entire Irrawaddy valley 
> and greatly reduced the hereditary rights of Shan chiefs. 
> Its trade and secular administrative reforms built a prosperous economy for more than 80 years.
>
> The kingdom entered a gradual decline due to the "palace rule" of its kings. 
> Starting from the 1720s, the kingdom was beset with 
> raids by the Meitei people of the Chindwin River, and a rebellion in Chiang Mai. 
> 
> Raids by the Meitei intensified in the 1730s, reaching increasingly deeper parts of central Burma. 
> 
> In 1740, the Mon people in Lower Burma began a rebellion, 
> founding the Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom. 
> 
> The Hanthawaddy armies captured Inwa in 1752 and ended the 266-year-old Toungoo dynasty.
